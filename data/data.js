      "Our school organize study tours programs every summer and winter. The UK immersion program run by GK(Great Kids Education) in last winter has been the best in my eye. GK has been very dedicated, dependable, and professional during the whole journey. The daily group reflections they faciliated were definetely the highlight of the program. We could see they embrace an educational spirit that makes them different from other suppliers. We would love to take GK as my core partner for furture programs.",

      "I enjoyed the Cambridge University program a lot. We were given opportunities to explore by ourselves while being given inspiring guidance. Both in the entertaining activities and in the academic learning, we were naturally engaged. Mostly I really appreciate our facilitator Vivi who cared for us in a sincere way. She listened, encouraged, and never judged. The suggestions she had given were very helpful and valuable to me.",

Not only we got to know Chiangmai , but also we learned a lot about fostering a good relationship with children. We have highly recommended the program to my other friends.      ",
